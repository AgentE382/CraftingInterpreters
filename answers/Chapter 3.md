# Challenges
1. Write some sample Lox programs and run them (you can use the implementations of Lox in my repository). Try to come up with edge case behavior I didn't specify here. Does it do what you expect? Why or why not?
2. This informal introduction leaves a _lot_ unspecified. List several open questions you have about the language's syntax and semantics. What do you think the answers should be?
3. Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of course.)
  1. Integers (or math.floor / ceil)
  2. Modulus operator
  3. Arrays
  4. Exponentiation operator
  5. Bitwise operators / library functions for binary data structures
  6. String conversion
  7. File input / output
  8. User input
